### Description

I wanted to get to know Unity, so I started with making Pong in Unity. It's a basic game to get familiar with the Engine and learn about the process of making a game.

### How To Play

Download the Pong_x.x.x.zip file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Timii-i/Pong/releases), unzip it and start the .exe file.
